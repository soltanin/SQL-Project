# Final-Project-Transforming-and-Analyzing-Data-with-SQL

## Project/Goals
(fill in your description and goals here)
My goal was cleaning data in order to answer question properly

## Process
### (your step 1)
Importing data
### (your step 2)
considering columns of tables one by one to find and solve any problem in data.

## Results
(fill in what you discovered this data could tell you and how you used the data to answer those questions)
The data was too messay. It probaby is very common in real world applications.
Actually I am not sure how I must deal with null values

## Challenges 
(discuss challenges you faced in the project)
The most challenge for me was about checking columns with varchar type data. I did not know how should I check spell of them,
or how should i check their consistency

## Future Goals
(what would you do if you had more time?)
Discuss more with my classmates about the project, or discuss with mentors about details
